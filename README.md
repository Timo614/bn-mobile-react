BigNeon React Native Repo

This is the react native Big Neon Mobile App repository, part of the Big Neon ticketing system.

# Overall project architecture

Big Neon is a multi-tiered micro-services architecture for selling and managing tickets. The software system is made up
of multiple components. As such, the code is split across multiple repositories. To get an overall picture of how
everything fits together have a look at the [docs repository]( https://github.com/big-neon/docs.git)
