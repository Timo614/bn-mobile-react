## The Project Brief
This is a Fork of the original Big Neon [project](). Revelry is participating in an open source contribution for Big Neon. 
We will be working from this forked repository and submitting Pull Requests back to the original repo. From the original Big Neon repo:

>Big Neon is a multi-tiered micro-services architecture for selling and managing tickets. The software system is made up 
>of multiple components. As such, the code is split across multiple repositories. To get an overall picture of how 
>everything fits together have a look at the [docs repository]( https://github.com/big-neon/docs.git)
